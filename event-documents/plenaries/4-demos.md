## Decentralized Vaccination Registry Using IPID

DID atop of IPFS using IPNS, called IPID.

A DPKI that allows direct communication between patient and doctor.

Works today! Still needs some selective disclosure!

## DID Client

Command-line application that creates DIDs, rotates keys, etc. It's meant to be ledger-agnostic.

## Credential Handler API

A polyfill for web browsers. Allows user to authorize credentials being sent to repository and later authorize sending them out.

## Uport

Uport is used to scan QR codes for verifiable claims.
