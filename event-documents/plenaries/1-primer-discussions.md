# What We Learned from Discussing Our Primers
## Functional Identity

Wants funtional identity to be a revolution that's afterward obvious.
"Identity is how we keep track of people".

What We Learned New:

   1. It's founded on a _subjective_ perception of identity
   2. It's not identity as a thing, but a _function_.
   3. It's about enabling conversation and engineering.

Other Peoples' Thoughts:

   1. It's about correlation: marries identity to verifiable claims.
   2. Your identity only has value if it's useful is an old concept that bridges to functional identity
   
## Self-Sovereign Identity

Main Issue Raised:

*Economics.* In order to have individual rights of self-sovereign-identity, there has to be social and technological infrastructure that can enforce and support rights! Laws, religious traditions, and even violence are all classic ways to enforce rights. But we have new ways to architect in digital age. 

But, how are these technological infrastructures to be sustained? Traditionally, we have platform capitalism, where platform holds identity and generates revenue in some way. With blockchains, we have totally different incentives to incentivize the growth of the network. 

There are no final answers to how to approach this problem, but the question of sustainability and economics and how digital rights will be protected and enforced is critical.

Other Peoples' Thoughts:

   1. The crypto-economics of the web of trust might be a reframing of this topic.
   2. Connections to GPDR are interesting, and how self-sovereign identity could help address these problems.
