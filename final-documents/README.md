# Rebooting the Web of Trust V (Fall 2017) Final Papers

## [*ActivityPub: From Decentralized to Distributed Social Networks*](activitypub-decentralized-distributed.pdf) [(Text)](activitypub-decentralized-distributed.md)
#### by Christopher Lemmer Webber & Manu Sporny

> An overview of the W3C ActivityPub protocol.

## [*A Decentralized Approach to Blockcerts Credential Revocation*](blockcerts-revocation.pdf) [(Text)](blockcerts-revocation.md)
## JoÃ£o Santos & Kim Hamilton Duffy

> Blockcerts are blockchain-anchored credentials with a verification process designed to be decentralized and trustless. This proposal describes an alternate method of issuing Blockcerts using Ethereum, which allows for a new form of revocation by either the issuer or the recipient.

## [*Identity Hubs Capabilities Perspective*](identity-hubs-capabilities-perspective.pdf) [(Text)](identity-hubs-capabilities-perspective.md)
#### by Adrian Gropper, Drummond Reed & Mark S. Miller

> Identity Hubs as currently proposed in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) are a subset of a general Decentralized Identifier (DID) based user-controlled agent, based on ACLs rather than an object-capabilities (ocap) architecture. Transitioning the Hubs design to an ocap model can be achieved by introducing an UMA authorization server as the control endpoint.

## [*Linked Data Capabilities*](lds-ocap.pdf) [(Text)](lds-ocap.md)
#### Christopher Lemmer Webber & Mark S. Miller

> Linked Data Signatures enable a method of asserting the integrity of linked data documents that are passed throughout the web. The object capability model is a powerful system for ensuring the security of computing systems. 

## [*Veres One DID Method*](did-method-veres-one.pdf) [(Text)](did-method-veres-one.md)
#### by Manu Sporny & Dave Longley

> The Veres One Ledger is a permissionless public ledger designed specifically for the creation and management of decentralized identifiers (DIDs). This specification defines how a developer may create and update DIDs in the Veres One Ledger.
