## Rebooting the Web of Trust V: Boston (October 2017)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT5, the fifth Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which is to run in Boston, Massachusetts, on October 3rd-5th, 2017. The goal of the workshop was to generate five technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that would have the greatest impact on the future.

_Please see the [Web of Trust Info website](http://www.weboftrust.info/) for more information about our community, including upcoming events._

##  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
*  A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

Please see the [Advance Readings README](topics-and-advance-readings/README.md) for a listing of all of the papers.

## Completed Papers

The design workshop met its goal of three to five white papers with four to-date, and others ongoing.

## [*ActivityPub: From Decentralized to Distributed Social Networks*](final-documents/activitypub-decentralized-distributed.pdf) [(Text)](final-documents/activitypub-decentralized-distributed.md)
#### by Christopher Lemmer Webber & Manu Sporny

> An overview of the W3C ActivityPub protocol.

## [*Identity Hubs Capabilities Perspective*](final-documents/identity-hubs-capabilities-perspective.pdf) [(Text)](final-documents/identity-hubs-capabilities-perspective.md)
#### by Adrian Gropper, Drummond Reed & Mark S. Miller

> Identity Hubs as currently proposed in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) are a subset of a general Decentralized Identifier (DID) based user-controlled agent, based on ACLs rather than an object-capabilities (ocap) architecture. Transitioning the Hubs design to an ocap model can be achieved by introducing an UMA authorization server as the control endpoint.

## [*Linked Data Capabilities*](final-documents/lds-ocap.pdf) [(Text)](final-documents/lds-ocap.md)
#### Christopher Lemmer Webber & Mark S. Miller

> Linked Data Signatures enable a method of asserting the integrity of linked data documents that are passed throughout the web. The object capability model is a powerful system for ensuring the security of computing systems. 

## [*Veres One DID Method*](final-documents/did-method-veres-one.pdf) [(Text)](final-documents/did-method-veres-one.md)
#### by Manu Sporny & Dave Longley

> The Veres One Ledger is a permissionless public ledger designed specifically for the creation and management of decentralized identifiers (DIDs). This specification defines how a developer may create and update DIDs in the Veres One Ledger.
