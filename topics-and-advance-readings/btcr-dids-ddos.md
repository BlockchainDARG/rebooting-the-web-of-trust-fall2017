# BTCR DIDs and DDOs

IN PROGRESS

By Kim Hamilton Duffy, Learning Machine

This document describes BTCR DIDs and DDOs using the default example shown in the [BTCR Playground](https://weboftrustinfo.github.io/btcr-tx-playground.github.io/). 

## Creating a BTCR DID

### Abbreviations

- Bi = bitcoin address i
- Pi = public key i
- Si = signing key i

### Creating a BTCR DID (P2PKH, no DDO)

- Create key set (`B0`/`P0`/`S0`)
- Create key set (`B1`/`P1`/`S1`)
- Create Bitcoin transaction as follows:
	- Output is `B1`
	- Signing key is `S0`
- Issue TX0 and wait for confirmation. Get bech32 encoding of the transaction `BECH32(TX0)`

At this point we have a DID of the format: 
```
did:btcr:<BECH32(TX0)>
```

### Verify/lookup keys

- Given a DID, we know txid (`did:btcr:<BECH32(TX0)>`)
- Look up transaction. Is output spent?
    - if so, keep following transaction chain until an unspent output is found

### Rotating keys

- Create new tx like above, but send to `B2`
- Sign tx with `S1` (P1 is revealed)

## Getting BTCR DID/DDOs from a transaction

The playground supports looking up BTCR DDOs for both mainnet and testnet chains. In general, we work with the testnet chain in these examples as we experiment with and develop BTCR.

The playground supports 3 means of entering a transaction:
- TXID and chain (testnet or mainnet)
- TX Ref (note that we don't need to enter the chain; described below)
- TX block height, index, and chain (testnet or mainnet)

## BTCR DID format

To start, click "Convert from TXID" on the site with the default transaction id. This testnet txid resolves to @ChristopherA's testnet BTCR DID -- `did:btcr:xyv2-xzyq-qqm5-tyke/0#transaction-key`.

The DID follows the [standard scheme](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/):

  did:<method>:<specific-idstring>

In this case, the method is "btcr". In the BTCR DID method, `specific-idstring` is a TX Refs of confirmed transactions in a Bitcoin chain.

### About TX Refs
TX Refs are described in BIP 136 "Bech32 Encoded Transaction Position References" (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/555). Among other advantages, they provide a concise way to refer to the confirmed transaction on a specific chain (testnet or mainnet) as a function of the block height and index. 

The important difference is that txid is just a hash of the transaction, which may not yet be confirmed, and does not encode the chain, whereas TX Ref must be confirmed (since it is based on the block height and index).

## Fragments and Deterministic DDOs

BTCR DDOs are divided into fragments. 

The first fragment is referred to as fragment /0 or "Deterministic DDO".  Everything in DDO fragment /0 can be deterministically created from the Bitcoin transaction alone. 

If the Bitcoin transaction has an OP_RETURN output, it is assumed to be a reference to a DDO "continuation", referred to as fragment /1. This is necessary, for example, if the DDO contains multiple keys. We cannot store all this data in the OP_RETURN output field, so we reference the data in an external store.

The concept of fragments is important for BTCR DDOs in the case that DDO continuation is stored in an immutable store such as IPFS. DDO cannot be signed until BTCR DID is available. But that would change the content, which changes the value in the OP_RETURN.

## Fragment /0, or the Deterministic DDO

Fragment /0 from the default BTCR Playground example is listed here:

### About
- `hash` and `txid` are listed separately because with segwit, these values may be different
- `more-ddo-<asm|hex|txt>`: These are different encodings of the same thing; if present, the txt variant will contain a link to the DDO continuation, or "fragment /1".
  - In theory, if the data pointed to is immutable (in content-addressable store like IPFS) AND if we can use */1 syntax (see below), then there is an implicit signature by DDO fragment /0
- `owner`: 
  - for BTCR, this is the key used to sign the transaction
- `claim-issuer`: this is also the tx signing key
- `control`: contains hash of key that can perform rotation or revocation. Note: in general it can be key, but in BTCR, only the hash is revealed. 
- `control bond`:funds at time of signing (not a bitcoin notion). Represents funds in that account
- `signature`: term is from LD signatures, but we may not want to use this term for indirect signatures (i.e. by virtue of being part of a signed tx).


## Fragment /1

Note: currently this differs from what's shown in the playground. We are working on updating samples. This version is the correct one.

    }
  }
}
```

### About

#### * syntax

In the DDO /1 fragment, we need to know the DID in fragment /0 for use in the `id`s. However, the `id`s cannot yet be known (as mentioned above, the DID isn't known until we issue the transaction). We're currently working around this by using the notation `"*/1#<fragment>"`

We considered using IPNS to work around this, but this allows only single-keyed updates.

#### The transaction implicitly signs fragment /1 if the OP_RETURN value is a content addressable hash
If fragment /1 is a content addressable hash, then tx signature is implicitly a signature for fragment /1.

#### Claim-issuer
`claim-issuer` appends unless id is same (main case for id being the same is to revoke with details)

#### Censorship resistance
- with IPFS URI of raw hash value; this is not-censorship resistant 
- First BTCR DID does not need an OP_RETURN. This increases censorship resistance. Subsequently must have OP_RETURN

## Constructed DDOs

Constructed DDO is the current DDO based on state machine events. DDOs have almost nothing to do with VC, but we can shove VCs into a DDO.

Synthesized values are read from a Verifiable Claims arrray

- Two different processors may come up with different end results, because they trust different sources
- Can yield different views:
  - I want to see what Christopher is saying about himself, don't care about anything else
  - I was to see what the US government is saying about Christopher, ...

Result is a "constructed identity"

```
DDO portion | DDO supplement + self-signed VC  | Just VCs    | Constructed Identity
```

```
DIDsm    op_return  URI                     schema pointer
0a         -> 1a                             ->            2a -  3a   | 0a 1a  2a 3a
0b         -> 1b+a                           ->  2a -> 3a   | 0b 1ba 2a 3a
0c         -> 1c                             -> (2a -> 3a)  | 0c 1c
```

Constructed DDO (current DDO based on all state machine events):

```
{
  id: ‘did:xxxxx:yyyyyy’,
  attribute1: value1, // synthesized values
  attribute2: value2,
  attribute3: value3, // signed by a claim that is then signed by signature
  credential: [ … array of verifiable claims …], // data read from blockchain
  signature: … // depends on blockchain
}
```

can be a result of reading claims, e.g.:
```
claim: {
  id: ‘did:xxxxx:yyyyyy’,
  attribute1: value1,
}
signature: { … any issuer that the system building the constructed identity trusts ends up being a synthesized value above … }
```

In this case, the constructed id is what I say about myself. Don’t necessarily need to counter-sign; by listing it we actually signed it.

About claim signatures:
- claims can use different set of keys
- claims do not have to be signed by owner key


## Key categories

Insight from BTCR Hackathon: we need to come up with something better than "owner"/"control". One approach is to describe what the key can be used, e.g. for proof of ownership, keys for making other claims (e.g. PGP).

- owner:
   - person who can owns the DDO
   - In this BTCR design, there is only 1 owner key. But note that other DID methods can have multiple owner keys
- keys or proofs allows to prove that DDO belongs to DID
- Only 1 key for signing DDO itself
  - and updating it ??? (is this true? what if output to multiple addresses or other scheme?)
- Control key lets you point to a new DDO
  - In this BTCR design, there is only 1 control key. But note that other DID methods can have multiple control keys
  - who controls ability to change to new DDO
  - control key becomes signing key
- instead of signatures/keys, call them proofs
