If you will be attending Rebooting the Web of Trust Fall 2017 in Boston, Massachusetts, please upload your topic papers and advanced readings to this directory with a pull request (or, if you don't know how, post an issue). 

##  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
* A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

The advanced readings published to date are:

* [#RebootingWebOfTrust User Story & Tech Concept](topics-and-advance-readings/RWOT-User-Story.md) by Christopher Allen
* [Framework for the Comparison of Identity Systems](topics-and-advance-readings/Framework-for-Comparison-of-Identity-Systems.md) by Kyle Den Hartog
* [Owned vs. Unowned Claims and Self-Sovereign Identity](topics-and-advance-readings/owned-vs-unowned-claims-and-ssi.md) by Natalie Smolenski
