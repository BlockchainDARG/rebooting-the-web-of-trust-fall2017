# Veres One DID Method Specification
***by Manu Sporny, Dave Longley, and Matt Collier, Digital Bazaar***

## Introduction

The Veres One Ledger is a permissionless public ledger designed specifically 
for the creation and management of decentralized identifiers (DIDs). Veres 
One DIDs are self-sovereign identifiers that may be used by people, 
organizations, and digital devices to establish an identifier that is 
under their control. 

Veres One DIDs are useful in ecosystems where one needs to issue, store, and 
use Verifiable Claims. 

The Veres One DID Method specification has been implemented and a
testnet is available here:

There is a video demo of a DID being registered and retrieved from the
Veres One Testnet here:

The current draft of the Veres One DID Method specification is available here:

## Collaboration

We would like to collaborate with the other DID Method implementers at 
Rebooting the Web of Trust to align both the core DID specification as well
as other DID Method specifications. We are also seeking to partner with
organizations that would be interested in integrating Veres One DIDs into their
platform to field test the capabilities of the specifications and technologies.
We are also interested in developing common technologies that can not only
access and update the Veres One DID ledger, but other ledgers as well.
